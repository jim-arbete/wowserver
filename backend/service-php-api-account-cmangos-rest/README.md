Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

# Laravel - Lumen cheatsheet #
  * Run Lument console, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bin/console`
  * Shell into the composer container to add packages, `docker-compose exec composer bash`
  * The --rm switch tells Docker to automatically clean up and remove the container after doing the task, `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer/composer install`
  * With Docker Compose `docker-compose run --rm -w /var/www/app app composer`

  ## Services exposed outside your environment ##

You can access your application via **`localhost`**, if you're running the containers directly, or through **``** when run on a vm. nginx and mailhog both respond to any hostname, in case you want to add your own hostname on your `/etc/hosts` 

Service|Address outside containers
------|---------|-----------
Webserver|[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Hosts within your environment ##

You'll need to configure your application to use any services you enabled:

Service|Hostname|Port number
------|---------|-----------
php-fpm|php-fpm|9000

# Docker compose cheatsheet #

**Note:** you need to cd first to where your docker-compose.yml file lives.

  * Start containers in the background: `docker-compose build --no-cache php-fpm`
  * Start containers in the background: `docker-compose up -d`
  * Start containers on the foreground: `docker-compose up`. You will see a stream of logs for every container running.
  * Stop containers: `docker-compose stop`
  * Kill containers: `docker-compose kill`
  * Remove containers when setting new values: `docker-compose rm -f`
  * View container logs: `docker-compose logs`
  * Execute command inside of container: `docker-compose exec SERVICE_NAME COMMAND` where `COMMAND` is whatever you want to run. Examples:
        * Shell into the PHP container, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bash`
        * Run symfony console, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bin/console`
        * Open a mysql shell, `docker-compose exec mysql mysql -uroot -pCHOSEN_ROOT_PASSWORD`

# Recommendations #

It's hard to avoid file permission issues when fiddling about with containers due to the fact that, from your OS point of view, any files created within the container are owned by the process that runs the docker engine (this is usually root). Different OS will also have different problems, for instance you can run stuff in containers using `docker exec -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) CONTAINER_NAME COMMAND` to force your current user ID into the process, but this will only work if your host OS is Linux, not mac. Follow a couple of simple rules and save yourself a world of hurt.

  * Run composer outside of the php container, as doing so would install all your dependencies owned by `root` within your vendor folder.
  * Run commands (ie Symfony's console, or Laravel's artisan) straight inside of your container. You can easily open a shell as described above and do your thing from there.
